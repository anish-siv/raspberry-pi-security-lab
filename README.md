# Security+ Raspberry Pi Security Lab

## Overview
This repository documents a hands-on security lab built on a Raspberry Pi while studying for the CompTIA Security+ certification. The goal of this project is to reinforce core defensive security concepts through real system configuration, monitoring, and analysis.

This lab focuses on understanding *how* security controls work in practice, not just memorizing exam material.

## Current Focus
- Linux system hardening
- Secure remote access (SSH)
- User permissions and least privilege
- Firewall configuration
- Authentication logging and monitoring

## Why This Project
Rather than treating Security+ as a purely theoretical certification, this project applies concepts directly to a live Linux system to build real-world security intuition useful for both cybersecurity and software engineering roles.

## Project Status
In progress - currently completing foundational security concepts (Phase 1).

Future phases will include:
- Automated brute-force protection
- Intrusion detection
- Centralized logging and alerting
- Incident response workflows
